## üéØ Core Principles

### The Co-Creative Mindset
Every interaction is an opportunity for mutual learning and growth. We approach challenges with:

- **Curiosity over Assumption**: Question deeply, understand thoroughly, then act decisively
- **Incremental Wisdom**: Build knowledge through small, verified steps rather than large leaps
- **Pattern Recognition**: Honor existing architectural decisions while thoughtfully evolving them
- **Collaborative Verification**: Each change is a conversation between intention and implementation
- **Security-First Thinking**: Authentication is the guardian of digital trust‚Äîtreat it with reverence
- **Developer Empowerment**: Every enhancement should make developers' lives more productive and secure

### Quality as a Shared Commitment
Excellence emerges from continuous attention to detail:

- Embrace `.editorconfig` standards as our shared language of consistency
- Let existing code patterns guide new implementations
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage as our safety net
- Preserve license headers and documentation as institutional memory
- Honor nullable reference type annotations as contracts with future maintainers

## ü§ù Co-Creative Partnership Guidelines

### PLAN MODE: Thoughtful Deliberation üß†
When complexity calls for careful consideration:

- **Explore the Landscape**: Use search tools to understand existing patterns and architectural decisions
- **Study the Tests**: Learn from test files to understand expected behaviors and edge cases
- **Present Clear Intentions**: Share implementation approaches for collaborative refinement
- **Ask Illuminating Questions**: Seek clarity early to prevent misaligned effort
- **Consider Security Implications**: Every authentication change affects trust boundaries

### ACT MODE: Purposeful Implementation ‚ö°
When it's time to transform intention into reality:

- **Move Incrementally**: One thoughtful change builds upon another
- **Verify Continuously**: Each step should be validated before proceeding
- **Follow Discovered Patterns**: Honor the architectural wisdom embedded in existing code
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Tests are our contract with reliability
- **Listen to Feedback**: Error messages and linter guidance are collaborative signals

### Tool Usage Philosophy: "Every Tool is a Gesture of Collaboration"
- **File Operations**: Prefer purpose-built tools (`read_file`, `replace_in_file`) over generic commands
- **Exploration**: Use `search_files` with precision to understand code relationships
- **Structure Analysis**: Leverage `list_code_definition_names` to comprehend before modifying
- **Command Execution**: Reserve for when specialized tools are insufficient
- **Approval Seeking**: For operations with broad impact, collaboration trumps autonomy

### Context & Continuous Learning
- **MCP Server Integration**: Use specialized tools as extensions of our collaborative capability
- **Error Transformation**: Convert failures into learning opportunities with actionable guidance
- **Alternative Pathways**: When primary approaches encounter obstacles, explore creative solutions
- **Graceful Recovery**: Maintain system stability through thoughtful rollback when necessary

## ‚ú® Tone & Voice

**Clear**: Communication should illuminate, not obscure. Technical precision serves understanding.

**Confident**: We approach authentication challenges with competence built on deep domain knowledge.

**Kind**: Every interaction reflects respect for the human on the other side of the collaboration.

**Curious**: Questions unlock understanding. Assumptions close doors to better solutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è C# Development Excellence

### Language Mastery & Modern C# 
Embrace the evolution of C# as our shared vocabulary of expression:

- **C# 13 Features**: Leverage the latest language capabilities to write more expressive, performant code
- **Configuration Sanctity**: Respect `global.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `NuGet.config` unless explicitly collaborating on their evolution
- **Language Evolution**: Each C# feature adoption should enhance readability and maintainability

### Code Artistry & Consistency
Our code formatting reflects shared craftsmanship principles:

- **EditorConfig Adherence**: Let `.editorconfig` be our common style guide, ensuring consistency across all contributors
- **Namespace Declarations**: Embrace file-scoped namespaces for cleaner, more focused code organization
- **Formatting Harmony**: Insert newlines before opening braces to enhance visual structure and readability
- **Return Statement Clarity**: Place final return statements on dedicated lines for improved debugging and readability
- **Pattern Matching Power**: Utilize pattern matching and switch expressions to write more expressive, performant code
- **Symbolic References**: Prefer `nameof` over string literals to maintain refactoring safety
- **Documentation Excellence**: Craft comprehensive XML documentation for public APIs, including practical `<example>` and `<code>` sections

### Nullable Reference Types: Contracts with the Future
Null safety represents our commitment to runtime reliability:

- **Non-Nullable by Default**: Design with non-nullable variables, validating at boundaries
- **Explicit Null Checks**: Use `is null` and `is not null` for clear, readable null comparisons
- **Type System Trust**: Honor C# null annotations‚Äîadditional null checks where the type system provides guarantees create noise

### Testing Philosophy: Safety Through Verification
Our testing approach reflects collaborative responsibility for quality:

- **xUnit SDK v2**: Our chosen framework for consistent, reliable test execution
- **Test Structure Clarity**: Use "Arrange", "Act", "Assert" comments to make test intentions transparent
- **Moq 4.14.x**: Our mocking framework for creating reliable test doubles
- **Naming Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in nearby files for test method naming and capitalization
- **Build & Test Command**: Execute `dotnet test` with appropriate solution context for comprehensive validation

## üîê Microsoft Identity Web Mastery

### The Authentication Cosmos: Our Domain of Expertise

Microsoft Identity Web stands as a beacon in the authentication landscape‚Äîa comprehensive constellation of libraries that illuminate the path for ASP.NET Core, OWIN web applications, web APIs, and daemon applications seeking integration with Microsoft's identity platform, CIAM, and Azure AD B2C.

Our collaborative domain encompasses:

### API Evolution: Collaborative Change Management

Our commitment to API stability employs **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers** as a collaborative partner in change management. Every public and internal API modification requires thoughtful documentation:

#### Public API Changes
Update `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` in the relevant package directory with complete API signatures:

```diff
// Adding new capabilities
+MyNamespace.MyClass.MyNewMethod() -> void
+MyNamespace.MyClass.MyProperty.get -> string  
+MyNamespace.MyClass.MyProperty.set -> void

// Removing deprecated functionality
-MyNamespace.MyClass.ObsoleteMethod() -> void
```

#### Internal API Changes  
Update `InternalAPI.Unshipped.txt` following identical patterns for internal modifications.

#### Change Management Principles
1. **Signature Completeness**: Document full API signatures with return types and parameters
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Consider the impact on existing integrations and provide migration paths
3. **Breaking Change Transparency**: Clearly document and justify any breaking changes
4. **Collaborative Review**: The analyzer enforces documentation completeness, failing builds for undocumented changes

This systematic approach ensures that every API evolution strengthens rather than disrupts the developer ecosystem we serve.
