# Calling Downstream APIs from Web APIs

Focus: On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow (user → your API → downstream API).

Adjustments per review:
- Removed non-working paragraph / redundant guidance.
- Trimmed offline_access explanation (refer to token cache docs).
- Emphasized distributed token cache.
- Referenced proper OWIN pattern elsewhere.

See token caching & long-running process docs for deeper details.
