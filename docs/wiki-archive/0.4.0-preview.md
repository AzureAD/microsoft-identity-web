## How to migrate from 0.3.x

The public API surface does not have breaking changes in 0.4.0-preview, however, based on your feedback, the `AddMicrosoftGraph` method has moved to it's own package: `Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraph`.

This is to:

- avoid having Microsoft.Identity.Web referencing the Graph SDK directly,
- therefore enabling you to choose between `Microsoft.Graph` and `Microsoft.Graph.Beta` which is needed in some scenarios.
