Microsoft Identity Web has adopted [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), the industry standard for OSS projects.

Per the semantic versioning spec, breaking changes (a.k.a. incompatible changes) will only be released with a major version bump. When that happens, we will document that change in the [release notes](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/releases) and provide a migration aid if applicable.
