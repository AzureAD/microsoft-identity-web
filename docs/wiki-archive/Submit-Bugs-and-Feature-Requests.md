### Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search of [open issues](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use the tags to narrow down your search.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

üëç - upvote

üëé - downvote

If your issue is a question, and is not addressed in the wiki documentation, please ask the question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) using the tags `web app, web api, asp.net core`.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature request, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Write Detailed Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per bug and feature request

- Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

When [submitting an issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues/new/choose), select the correct category, **Bug Report**, **Documentation**, or **Feature request**.

### Bug Report

The more information you provide, the more likely someone will be successful in reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
Please use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and complete as much of the information listed as possible. Please use the [latest version of the library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/releases) and see if your bug still exists before filing an issue.
Remember to do the following:

- Search the issue repository to see if there exists a duplicate issue. 
- Update to the latest version of the library to see if the issue still exists.
- Submit an issue by filling out all as much of the information in the Bug Report as possible.

### Documentation Requests

If you find our wiki or xml comments are lacking in necessary documentation to make your life easier using the library, submit a [Documentation request](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues/new?template=documentation.md) and let us know what you need, if you have found errors in the documentation, or if an example or code snippet is needed. Feel free to include suggestions.

### Feature Requests

Have a feature request for MSAL? Complete a [Feature Request](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) or consider making a [contribution](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/Contributing-overview) to the library. Make sure your feature request is clear and concise and contains a detailed description of the problem. Please include any alternative solutions or features you may have considered.
